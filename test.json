    "description": "From: globus@nas.nasa.gov (Al Globus)\nSubject: Space Colony Size Preferences Summary\nOrganization: Applied Research Office, NASA Ames Research Center\nReply-To: globus@nas.nasa.gov\nDistribution: sci.space\nLines: 92\n\n\nSome time ago I sent the following message:\n   Every once in a while I design an orbital space colony.  I'm gearing up to\n   do another one.  I'd some info from you. If you were to move\n   onto a space colony to live permanently, how big would the colony have\n   to be for you to view a permanent move as desirable?  Specifically,\n\n   How many people do you want to share the colony with?\n \n\n   What physical dimensions does the living are need to have?  \n\n\n   Assume 1g living (the colony will rotate).  Assume that you can leave\n   from time to time for vacations and business trips.  If you're young\n   enough, assume that you'll raise your children there.\n\nI didn't get a lot of responses, and they were all over the block.\nThanx muchly to all those who responded, it is good food for thought.\n\n\n\n\nHere's the (edited) responses I got:\n\n\n   How many people do you want to share the colony with?\n \n100\n\n   What physical dimensions does the living are need to have?  \n\nCylinder 200m diameter x 1 km long\n\nRui Sousa\nruca@saber-si.pt\n\n=============================================================================\n\n>   How many people do you want to share the colony with?\n\n100,000 - 250,000\n\n>   What physical dimensions does the living are need to have?  \n\n100 square kms surface, divided into city, towns, villages and\ncountryside.  Must have lakes, rivers amd mountains.\n\n=============================================================================\n\n> How many\n1000.  1000 people really isn't that large a number;\neveryone will know everyone else within the space of a year, and will probably\nbe sick of everyone else within another year.\n\n>What physical dimensions does the living are need to have?  \n\nHm.  I am not all that great at figuring it out.  But I would maximize the\npercentage of colony-space that is accessible to humans.  Esecially if there\nwere to be children, since they will figure out how to go everywhere anyways.\nAnd everyone, especially me, likes to \"go exploring\"...I would want to be able\nto go for a walk and see something different each time...\n\n=============================================================================\n\nFor population, I think I would want a substantial town -- big enough\nto have strangers in it.  This helps get away from the small-town\n\"everybody knows everything\" syndrome, which some people like but\nI don't.  Call it several thousand people.\n\nFor physical dimensions, a somewhat similar criterion:  big enough\nto contain surprises, at least until you spent considerable time\ngetting to know it.  As a more specific rule of thumb, big enough\nfor there to be places at least an hour away on foot.  Call that\n5km, which means a 10km circumference if we're talking a sphere.\n\n                                         Henry Spencer at U of Toronto Zoology\n                                          henry@zoo.toronto.edu   utzoo!henry\n\n=============================================================================\nMy desires, for permanent move to a space colony, assuming easy communication\nand travel:\n\nSize:  About a small-town size, say 9 sq. km.  'Course, bigger is better :-)\nPopulation:  about 100/sq km or less.  So, ~1000 for 9sqkm.  Less is\nbetter for elbow room, more for interest and sanity, so say max 3000, min 300.\n\n-Tommy Mac\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTom McWilliams | 517-355-2178 (work) \\\\     Inhale to the Chief!\n18084tm@ibm.cl.msu.edu  | 336-9591 (hm)\\\\  Zonker Harris in 1996!\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
